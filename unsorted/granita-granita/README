Granita - Minimalist granular synth
-----------------------------------
Lorenzo Sutton <lorenzofsutton[theemailthing]gmail.com> - 2009 - 2012

Granita is a granular synthesis application for working on an audio buffere or
on a live-fed (optionally looped) array. A simple loop-recorder can be used to
feed the main array live.

I initially made this patch because in need of a simple and straightforward
granular tool for personal use and wanted to experiment on granulation and Pd.
It was heavily inspired by 'Microsound' by Curtis Roads (MIT Press - 2002):
http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?tid=8587&ttype=2.
Eventually I decided to tidy it up and share it. It is now pretty stable. No
precise plans for further development. Some bug fixes and improvements from
time to time. Anyone is of course welcome to improve/modify, fork etc. anyway.

Granita is minimal in that it doesn't include additional effects and the
controls are pretty straightforward:
- Open the main patch Granita.pd (alternatively Granita64.pd or Granita32.pd
for 32 an 64 voices see below)
- A typical Pd gui will come up - on Windows be patient: it takes much longer :|
- Open a wave file or record something with the recorder
- *turn up* the main volume and the dac (on the right) :)
- *turn on* granulation (Yellow trigger indicated with "main")
- start playing with the controls

Of course you can also route the main patch sends e.g. to send to an effect etc.
These are called [s~ granitaL] and [s~ granitaR]) and can be seen in any other
patch or effect with two simple [r~ granitaL] and [r~ granitaR] (in this case
consider muting the main volume).
This means Granita may or may not work for your granular needs...

Granular synthesis is usually quite resource demanding. Granita is no exception
(you have been warned!): the main patch, granita.pd, comes with 128 grain
polyphony per channel. This can be particularly CPU hungry depending on the
system but should work on fairly 'modern' systems which usually handle audio
(as said above performance seems better on linux though). Two lighter yet
decreasingly less effective versions are provided Granita64.pd and Granita32.pd
which have a polyphony of respectively 64 and 32 and thus cut CPU usage to
roughly 1/2 and 1/4. Experimentation will prove which is best to use and
finding the good quality/performance ratio depending on your needs.

Some 'pitch shifting' an 'time-stretching' can be done while
playing the grains along the file pointer. These are mostly intended as
granular effects are no way replacement for [your cool pitch shifting/time
stretching app/library/patch].

Granita works with Pd Vanilla.
It was tested on Pd for Linux and Windows (less). Some custom patches are
included in the package.

Feedback welcome and happy granulation ;)

Curiosity: 'Granita' in Italy is a summer drink made of crushed ice with syrup
in many flavours: it is very refreshing and is made of many 'grains' of ice!
I love the mint and tamarind flavours.
