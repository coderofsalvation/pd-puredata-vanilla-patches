---------------
- Granita is now pure Pd Vanilla.
- Removed motex/pan~ dependency. Replaced with self-made equal pan.
- Removed cyclone/prepend dependency. Replaced with list append

2012-02-11
---------------
- Added smooth edges to live loop recorder

1.0
---------------
- Made explicit call to motex/pan~ and cyclone/prepend. This makes Granita more
  vanilla-friendly (those libs from Extended are the only needed ones)
- Fixed some errors in looper for 32 and 64 versions.

0.9
---------------
- Fixed loop recorder external
  Small gui changes

0.8
---------------
- Removed interpolation for grains: i.e. tabread~ instead of tabread4~
  for lower CPU usage.
  I decided the (CPU) performance gain was worth it. Interpolation is really
  useful for extreme pitch shift.   Interpolation is still done on the envelope
  table.
  The version with [tabread4~] can still be used by renaming 'grain~_4point.pd'
  to 'grain~.pd'
